After cleaning, `restore_entities` puts originals back. Also collects **keywords** (entity strings) & **labels** for later analytics. |\n",

    "| **5. Row-wise pipeline** | `preprocess_text(df, \"text\", …)`<br/>→ dumps original to `text_orig` (if `suffix`) <br/>→ applies steps 3–5 <br/>→ returns cleaned `text`, plus new **keywords** & **labels** columns. |\n",
